# VUT-ISS-project (2022/2023)

Main goal of this project was to create graphs (for Fourier transformation, etc.) and to create a song using using `python` and a single `.waw` file. So that meant splitting the sounds as midis, storing them and then being able to recreate the song using included text file to recognize midi sounds.

## How to run it

To run this script, you will need to have python installed and some libraries. Those are:

- numpy
- soundfile
- matplotlib
- scipy
- IPython.display

When you have the python and libraries installed, you should be able to run this script that will create the music.

### If that does not work

If the python notebook does not work, you can use the singular python files, that are in the `src` folder. But the python notebook should work without a problem. Note that you should follow the order of programs as it is in the **python notebook** (located in `src/xlukas15.ipynb`) or you can look at the included documentation file in `xlukas15.pdf`.

## Tested python versions

- Python 3.8
- Python 3.9
- Python 3.10
- Python 3.11

## Final evaluation: 18/18
